This is a port of <a href='http://www.chocolate-doom.org'>Chocolate Doom 1.7.0</a> by Simon Howard to the Dingoo.

This port was made possible by the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk/'>Dingoo Native SDK</a> by Flatmush et al with SDL support by Harteex.

Unless any bugs appear in the near future version 1.2 will most likely be the final release.  I would like to add proper midi support with the Timidity library eventually but this is beyond my ability for the time being.

If you are downloading the binary for the first time you will also need the full <a href='http://code.google.com/p/dooom/downloads/detail?name=Dooom%201.0%20binary.zip&can=2&q='>version 1.0 archive</a> that includes the music folder.
